# Course Management System

This mini project is designed to help you apply the Python concepts you've learned so far. You will be creating a course management system that will allow you to create a course with its properties, explain the time of each module, the charges for each student, and so on.

## Project Description

In this project, you will be creating a course management system. The system will have the following features:

1. Create a course with its properties (course name, course duration, course modules, etc.)
2. Add students to the course and assign them a fee.
3. Display the details of the course.
4. Display the details of the students in the course.

## Instructions

1. Clone the starter code from the repository.
2. Create a dictionary to store the course details. The dictionary should have the following keys: 'course_name', 'course_duration', 'course_modules', 'course_fee'.
3. Create a function to add a course. The function should take the course details as input and add them to the dictionary.
4. Create a function to add students to the course. The function should take the student's name and fee as input and add them to a list of students.
5. Create a function to display the course details. The function should print the details of the course.
6. Create a function to display the students in the course. The function should print the names and fees of the students.
7. Test your functions by adding a course and some students, and displaying the course and student details.
